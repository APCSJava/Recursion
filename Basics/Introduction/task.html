<p>
    The repeated application of a recursive procedure.

    This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">Wikipedia</a> entry
    has some good things to say about recursion.

<p>
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/recursion-demystified-99a2105cb871/">Free Code Camp</a> takes a turn at
    it.

    And then there's even a <a href="https://www.getdigital.co.uk/Understanding-Recursion.html">t-shirt</a> having a go.

    Recursion is a problem solving approach where, in order to solve a potentially really large problem, you solve a
    slightly simpler version of the problem -- and a slightly simpler version of <i>that</i> problem, if need be --
    until you reach a sufficiently simple version of the problem to which you know the answer.
</p>
<h3>Example: factorial</h3>
<p>Assume someone asked you to determine the value of 12! (twelve factorial).</p>
<p>You probably don't know the value of 12! off the top of your head <b><i>but</i></b> you know that it
    must be equal to 12 multiplied by the value of 11! (eleven factorial).
</p>
<p>You probably don't have a clue what 11! equals, either, <b><i>but</i></b> you know for sure that
    it would be 11 multiplied by the value of 10! (ten factorial).
</p>
... <i>process continues</i>
<p>Eventually, you realize that in order to calculate the solution, you will need to determine the value of 2! and
    you recognize that 2! is simply 2. This is what is known as a <b><i>base case</i></b> -- a version of the problem
    that
    is sufficiently simple that the answer is readily evident.</p>
<p>Armed with a definitive value of 2! and knowing that 3! is simply 3 * 2!, you determine
    that 3! = 6. Likewise, since 4! is 4 * 3!, then 4! must be 4 * 6 = 24.  Continuing in this manner, you recursively
    work backwards from the base case to determine the value of 12! which was the original question.</p>
