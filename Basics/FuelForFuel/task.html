<h2>How much fuel does a rocket need?</h2>

<p>Getting a rocket into orbit is no easy matter. The [rocket] science is explored
    <a href="https://semiengineering.com/getting-to-orbit-and-the-rocket-equation/"> in this blog post </a>
    which describes the conditions needed to raise the rocket's velocity to the point where it can
    <a href="https://nationalpoetryday.co.uk/poem/high-flight/">"[slip] the surly bonds of earth" </a>
    and establish an orbit.
</p>
<p>One way of thinking about the problem is the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The payload (the important part of the craft) has a mass, m</li>
    <li>To accelerate mass m to the required velocity, some amount of fuel, x, is needed</li>
    <li>However, launching with an additional amount of fuel x on board brings the total rocket mass to m + x which is
        greater
        than the original mass, m, used in the calculation
    </li>
    <li>To accelerate additional mass x, some additional amount of fuel, y, is needed. This brings the total rocket mass
        to
        m + x + y
    </li>
    <li>To accelerate additional mass y, even more fuel, z, is needed</li>
    <li>... and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a recursive solution to calculate the amount of fuel required to place into orbit a body
    of the given mass. Assume that the amount of fuel necessary to accelerate a mass of m to the required
    velocity is given by the equation f = m / 3 - 2. Any value of f < 0 should be set to zero.
</p>
<p>Example calculation:<br/>
    <blockquote>
    <code>Recursions.calculateFuel(1000);</code><br/>
    // fuel required to lift the original payload of 1000<br/>
    1000 / 3 - 2 = 333 - 2 = 331 <br/>
    // fuel required to lift that additional 331 units of fuel</br>
    331 / 3 - 2 = 110 - 2 = 108<br/>
    // fuel required to lift that additional 108 units of fuel<br/>
    108 / 3 - 2 = 36 - 2 = 34<br/>
    // fuel required to lift that additional 34 units of fuel<br/>
    34 / 3 - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9<br/>
    // fuel required to lift that additional 9 units of fuel<br/>
    9 / 3 - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1<br/>
    // fuel required to lift that additional 1 unit of fuel<br/>
    1 / 3 - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2 -> 0 <br/>
    // no additional fuel needed so calculate the total<br/>
    returns 483 // (331 + 108 + 34 + 9 + 1 + 0)
