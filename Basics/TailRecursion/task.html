<h2>Tail recursion</h2>

<p>You may hear or read about tail recursion. Tail recursion occurs when the final statement in a method is a recursive
    call.
    All processing of data by the method has already completed by the time the recursive call is
    made, so there is no need for the stack frame to maintain program state -- after all, it isn't going to process the
    returned value. This allows tail recursive methods to be optimized.</p>
<p>If a method is NOT tail recursive, it means that additional statements may be executed when the nested
    recursive call returns and therefore all information on the stack frame must be retained in anticipation of
    resuming execution.
</p>
<p>
    Compare the outputs of the two methods shown.  Notice that one creates a recursive call <b><i>before</i></b>
    processing <i>n</i> while the second method processes <i>n</i> and <b><i>afterwards</i></b> makes its recursive
    call (ie. tail recursion).
</p>
<h2>What to take away</h2>
<p>
    Be aware that the placement of the recursive call can almost make it seem as if the data is being
    processed in reverse.  With this awareness, trace recursive methods carefully to determine whether they
    process data beginning with the initial parameter and proceeding down to the base case <b>or</b> recurse immediately
    to the base case and process values in reverse order during the return trip up the call stack.
