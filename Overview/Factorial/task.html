<h2>Using factorial as an example.</h2>

<p>
Write a recursive solution that calculates a factorial.  Keep in mind the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The factorial of 0 is equal to 1 // by definition</li>
    <li>The factorial of 1 is equal to 1 // by definition</li>
    <li>For all n greater than 1, n! = n * (n-1)!</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have written your solution, check it using the 'Check' button below.</p>
<p>Once your method is working correctly, compare it against the provided solution by
using the "Peek Solution..." link.</p>
