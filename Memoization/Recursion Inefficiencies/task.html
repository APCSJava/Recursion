<h2>What's going on?</h2>

<p>A solution to fib(10) involves calculating a solution to fib(9) and fib(8).
    A solution to fib(9) requires a solution to fib(8) and fib(7), etc. If we don't
    keep track of these calculations but produce them anew, then we are routinely
    undertaking calculations that have already been performed.</p>
<p>
    A really good tool for visualizing this process is <a href="http://cs.joensuu.fi/jeliot/"> Jeliot</a>.
    It is available as a *.jar file that will open up into a Java editor and runtime visualizer. It
    is worth the download even if you don't use it for full time Java development but
    occasionally might like a powerful visualization of the call stack.
</p>
<p>
    Another way to trace this code is to drop a breakpoint into the main() method
    and step your way into/over successive method calls. Try that and watch how the
    stack grows while executing the code.
</p>
<h2>This example</h2>
<p>This version of the code demonstrates how to use a static (class) variable
to count the number of method invocations.
