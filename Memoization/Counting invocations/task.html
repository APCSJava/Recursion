<h2>Observing inefficient behavior</h2>

<p>
    Notice that we've inserted a print statement that will produce a line
    of output whenever the method is invoked as well as the argument provided
    as a parameter.
</p>
<p>Run the code and count the lines of output.  Consider why so many calls
are necessary to calculate fibonacci(10).
</p>
<p>You may wish to start with a smaller value than 10 and gradually work back
    to 10 to see if a pattern emerges.
</p>
<p>
    Alternately, you could modify the class by adding a static counter variable
    and incrementing it each time fibonacci() is invoked, printing the final value
    from main().
