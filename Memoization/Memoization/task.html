<h2>Memoization to the rescue</h2>

<p>Memoization is a dynamic programming technique that keeps track of previously calculated
    values that are partial solutions to a problem in order to avoid repeatedly
    recalculating them.
</p>
<h2>Passing the memo data as a parameter</h2>
<p>
    In this example, we pass as an additional parameter an array of ints. Initially,
    the elements in this array are set to -1. However, as values are discovered they are
    inserted into the array at the appropriate index (ie. fibonacci(2)'s value is inserted at index 2).
</p>
<p>With memoization present, the contents of the array are checked before performing an
    "expensive" recursive call -- if already known, the value is returned directly from the array.
    If unknown, the value is calculated using recursion anyway but the result is then stored in the
    array to avoid recalculation in the future.
</p>
<p>
    Notice that the use of memoization here reduces the number of calls dramatically,
    from 177 to 19. If the calculation being performed were non-trivial, this would represent
    a significant savings in computation.
